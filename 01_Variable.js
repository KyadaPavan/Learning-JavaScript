/* There are three ways with which ypu can declare varabial in javascript 

1) var
2) let
3) const


var :-  var is a globally scoped variable and it can be updated and re-declared within its scope. 

let :-  let is block scoped variable and it can be updated but it can not be re-declared. 

const :- the value stored with the help of const can not be changed. const can neither be upadted or re-declared.
          const must be initialized during declaration unlike var and let.
